- start as simple as possible, even if it looks ugly. the idea is to allow ideas and tests to flow unhindered.
- once you think that your ability to test ideas is hindered by your lack of structure, then you add the structure, but only as much as you need.
- helpful to document the moment you're adding complexity, namely why you're doing it. that is an assumption that can be reviewed later.
